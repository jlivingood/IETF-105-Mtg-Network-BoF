Agenda 

Background: 
- For many years the IETF has maintained unique network requirements. Many of those requirements were developed prior to many hotels and venues deploying reliable and high-speed Internet access, as well as prior to the emergence of pervasive web encryption, public DNS services, easy-to-use VPNs, etc. 
- Given the changes in Internet technology, the changes in the capabilities of venues and hotels, and the new contracted NOC role, it seems like a good opportunity for the community to re-assess our IETF meeting network requirements.
- Recognizing that as the IETF has grown that a very large portion of meeting attendees, often as much as 1/2, do not stay at the primary IETF hotel, and that only the primary has the IETF network in the guest rooms.  Instead they use whatever the airbnb and hotel provide for Internet access. 

Key questions this BoF should explore:

1 - Do we need to manage connectivity for guest rooms? 

2 - Can we simplify, evolve, or eliminate any network requirements? 

3 - Are there any network functions that could be delivered virtually rather than physically on-site?

4 - Are there new requirements to support the hackathon or other new technical initiatives?

5 - Can we prioritize key network requirements/functions into must have vs. nice to have (optional)?

6 - Do any NOC functions change based on changes in network requirements?

Information the BoF participants will need:
- [The IETF Meeting Network Requirements](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/admin/meeting-network-requirements/)
- The annual cost of maintaining the NOC function & IETF meeting network: "NOC Support" line item in [2019 Budget](https://www.ietf.org/documents/246/IETF_2019_Budget_Public_2018-12-19.pdf)
- Some stats on recent meeting venues that could not support the IETF based on network requirements.
